# Here is a list of the people trying to get revived: Tori Dahl, Tyler Tran, Aeva Cleare, Oliver Young, Justin Puno, Ashiq Kibria, Gavin Freeman, Sheila Argueta, Julia Song, Wooba Song, Julian Tay, James Gordon, and Papa Paintsil.
# To kill them, take a picture of them with their right hand touching something. The person who kills the most revives gets a special bonus entering the finals.
# To reiterate, you all are safe until revivals are over.'''
