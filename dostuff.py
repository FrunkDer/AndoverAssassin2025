#Congratulations! We're going to start spicing things up. From now on, instead of taking a picture of your target on their phone, you have to stick a post-it note/sticker onto your target without them noticing, take a picture of them with said post-it note on them, then send it in to @andover.2026. Your targets will also be reshuffled. Stay tuned to receive your target!''')
